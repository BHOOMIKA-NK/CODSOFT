TASK 3 : IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION 

Problem statement:
The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their
measurements. Now, imagine that you have the measurementsof Iris flowers categorized by their respective species.

1.Your objective is to train a machine learning model that can learn from these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into
their respective species.
2.Use the Iris dataset to develop a model that can classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal
measurements. This dataset is widely used for introductory classification tasks.
